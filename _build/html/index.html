<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Time Frame:  the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Time</span> <span class="pre">Frame</span></code> basically sets the time window for all the data you want to see below.

<p>Total # messages :  This shows you the total number of chat messages for the time period. It gives an idea about the number of queries/questions or comments coming in.</p>
<p>Total # Comments : This shows the total number of comments or replies that have been provided by users within a question on the public chat room.</p>
<p>Average Comments per message : This gives the average number of comments per message posted on the public chat .  This gives you an understanding of how many responses are there on average to a question or query posted- the engagement level.</p>
<p>Total # Product shares:  When a person chatting copy and pastes a URL of a link from your website on the chat window, it is considered a product share. This gives the total count of the product shares during the time frame. It is a good way to understand how many of your products/services your visitors/users are talking about and which are the popular ones.</p>
<p>Total #Users : This number tells you the new sign-ups that have happened in the time frame on y.Hatch for your website. It gives a good understanding of engagement patterns.</p>
<p>Average Messages per Chat: This feature is coming soon.  We are also introducing the ability for signed up users to talk in private with other users within the y.Hatch network . This number would be the average number of messages that have been exchanged over the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total</span> <span class="pre">number</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">private</span> <span class="pre">chats</span></code>.

<p>Upvoted Messages: This tells you the number of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upvotes</span></code> that have taken place .</p>
<p>Upvoted Replies : this tells you the number of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upvotes</span></code> that have been given to replies over the time period.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="coming-soon">
<h2>Coming soon<a class="headerlink" href="#coming-soon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are some new features that are coming very shortly to your yhatch chat interface.</p>
<p>WishList Adds:  This feature will be introduced soon. When a product share happens , or a poll takes place, we are planning to introduce a feature (UI button) by which a user can add that product to their wishlist. We will then share the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wishlist</span></code> details with you so that you can work on customized promotions.</p>
<p>Polls and Questions : Polls and questions will allow a user to create a poll that can be viewed and voted by everyone else. Imagine a situation where the user wants a crowd-sourced decision to select from 4 products or services.  Questions work similarly, where a user can ask a question and request for answers. The interesting thing about polls and questions is that it gives a structure to the questions, a user needs to categorize the poll or questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="manage-flags">
<h2>Manage Flags<a class="headerlink" href="#manage-flags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a very important part of your dashboard. This is where you will need to take action against comments/replies that have been flagged by users for moderation.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://clients.yhatch.com"><img alt="yhatch client dashboard" src="_images/flag-moderation.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p>You can see the User who has flagged it, the User who has posted the comment, the Comment itself, and the reason why it has been flagged. You will need to take action on the flagged comment by pressing 1 of the 2 buttons. If you would like to remove the comment from being seen in the front end by users, click <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ACCEPT</span></code>. If you think the flag was not justified and want to continue letting users see the comment, click on <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">REJECT</span></code>. Once moderated, you will not see the comment on the dashboard.</p>
<p>If a comment is has been flagged by multiple users, you will see multiple entries on the dashboard. However, you will need to moderate only 1 of the comments on the dashboard, and it will effect the other same entries as well.</p>

<h2>What is the y.Hatch Chat window?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-y-hatch-chat-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The y.Hatch chat window is a window that can be embedded on your website (and soon, integrated with your mobile app) where visitors to your website can concurrently chat with each other (and any of your representatives who may be online at the moment!). This allow visitors to quickly gain feedback about a product or service query that they may have.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-i-implement-it">
<h2>How do I implement it?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-implement-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The implementation steps are super simple and takes less than 5 minutes. These are explained in the earlier section. Check it out!</p>

<h2>How do my website visitors see it?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-my-website-visitors-see-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once the y.Hatch code is successfully implemented on your website, it will typically appear on the bottom right of your website as a chat bubble that says &#8220;Chat with other visitors/ See what others are saying&#8221;. Once the visitor clicks on it, it opens up on the right side and displays the public chat room.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-all-my-visitors-chat-from-it">
<h2>Can all my visitors chat from it?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-all-my-visitors-chat-from-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes! All visitors who are present on your website at that moment in time can chat  on it!</p>

<h2>Do visitors need to sign up before chatting?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-visitors-need-to-sign-up-before-chatting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<h2>What kind of questions can a user ask?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-kind-of-questions-can-a-user-ask" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any kind of question really! It might be do to with a product that they like and want to get opinions from fellow visitors about. Or it could be about a service. They might even have a support related question, in which case it is a great idea to always have a support representative as part of the chat room at all times :-).</p>

<p>Imagine a visitor who is trying to make up her mind between 2 tops , and wants a group opinion! All she has to do is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">create</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">poll</span></code> which gets posted instantly on the room, and allows people to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upvote</span></code> their choices!  This way, she can get a crowdsourced decision made!</p>
<p>Setting up  a poll is simple. There&#8217;s a button called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">POLL</span></code> in the chat box . A user has to simply click on it, ask the question (eg. &#8221; Which top do you guys think rocks?&#8221; )  , paste the 2 product option URLs on each of the option fields, and submit!   As simple as that, and the poll gets published for others to view and vote.</p>

<h2>How do people vote on a poll?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-people-vote-on-a-poll" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p>Not at all. A user can also put in free text . For example, a user on a travel portal may have a question &#8221; Which is a better destination for September?&#8221; And the options could be free text fields and he could enter &#8221; Bali&#8221; and &#8220;Maldives&#8221; as the 2 options.</p>

<h2>Are users allowed to report a comment they find offensive or inappropriate?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-users-allowed-to-report-a-comment-they-find-offensive-or-inappropriate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes they can.  For every comment posted on the main chat room or in the reply section, there is a Flag button (depicted with an &#8220;Exclamation&#8221; image) that a user can click. Upon clicking, he or she can choose the reason as to why it is inappropriate .</p>
<p>Once reported, you will see this comment on your Client Dashboard.  All you need to do is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ACCEPT</span></code> the Flag (if you want to remove the respective Flagged comment from the Chat window) or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">REJECT</span></code> it (if you want to allow the comment). If you ACCEPT the flag, it will automatically disappear from the Chat Window.  This ensures that moderation is managed.</p>
