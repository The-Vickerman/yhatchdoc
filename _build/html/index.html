<h2>Client Dashboard<a class="headerlink" href="#client-dashboard" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Y-Hatch <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Client</span> <span class="pre">Dashboard</span></code> is your home-base. This is your Admin Dashboard section where , upon logging in, you will be seeing the analytics activity of all that has happened on your chat window on your site. You will be able to copy/download the various tables to spreadsheets for your own analysis. You can also control your chat visual settings from here.</p>

<div class="section" id="chat">
<h2>Chat<a class="headerlink" href="#chat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Chat</span> <span class="pre">Window</span></code> is the soul of our product. Once the code is embedded on your website (we will tell you how), the chat window will appear on the bottom right of your website. You website visitors can potentially start chatting with others right from this window.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="y-aces-dashboard">
<h2>Y-ACES Dashboard<a class="headerlink" href="#y-aces-dashboard" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Y-ACES</span> <span class="pre">dashboard</span></code> is a dashboard created exclusively for your high engaging visitors.

<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">mobile</span> <span class="n">app</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">Y</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">ACES</span> <span class="n">Dashboard</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="n">coming</span> <span class="n">soon</span><span class="o">.</span>

<h2>What is the y.Hatch Chat window?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-y-hatch-chat-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The y.Hatch chat window is a window that can be embedded on your website (and soon, integrated with your mobile app) where visitors to your website can concurrently chat with each other (and any of your representatives who may be online at the moment!). This allow visitors to quickly gain feedback about a product or service query that they may have.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-i-implement-it">
<h2>How do I implement it?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-implement-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The implementation steps are super simple and takes less than 5 minutes. These are explained in the earlier section. Check it out!</p>

<h2>How do my website visitors see it?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-my-website-visitors-see-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once the y.Hatch code is successfully implemented on your website, it will typically appear on the bottom right of your website as a chat bubble that says &#8220;Chat with other visitors/ See what others are saying&#8221;. Once the visitor clicks on it, it opens up on the right side and displays the public chat room.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-all-my-visitors-chat-from-it">
<h2>Can all my visitors chat from it?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-all-my-visitors-chat-from-it" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes! All visitors who are present on your website at that moment in time can chat  on it!</p>

<h2>Do visitors need to sign up before chatting?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-visitors-need-to-sign-up-before-chatting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<h2>What kind of questions can a user ask?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-kind-of-questions-can-a-user-ask" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any kind of question really! It might be do to with a product that they like and want to get opinions from fellow visitors about. Or it could be about a service. They might even have a support related question, in which case it is a great idea to always have a support representative as part of the chat room at all times :-).</p>

<h2>What is a poll? How can a poll be set-up?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-poll-how-can-a-poll-be-set-up" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Imagine a visitor who is trying to make up her mind between 2 tops , and wants a group opinion! All she has to do is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">create</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">poll</span></code> which gets posted instantly on the room, and allows people to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upvote</span></code> their choices!  This way, she can get a crowdsourced decision made!</p>
<p>Setting up  a poll is simple. There&#8217;s a button called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">POLL</span></code> in the chat box . A user has to simply click on it, ask the question (eg. &#8221; Which top do you guys think rocks?&#8221; )  , paste the 2 product option URLs on each of the option fields, and submit!   As simple as that, and the poll gets published for others to view and vote.</p>

<h2>How do people vote on a poll?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-people-vote-on-a-poll" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once the poll is published, the voting is simple. A user simply has to click on the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upvote</span></code> button  (denoted by a &#8220;HEART&#8221; icon) to cast in their vote. 1 user is limited to 1 vote.

<p>Not at all. A user can also put in free text . For example, a user on a travel portal may have a question &#8221; Which is a better destination for September?&#8221; And the options could be free text fields and he could enter &#8221; Bali&#8221; and &#8220;Maldives&#8221; as the 2 options.</p>

<h2>Are users allowed to report a comment they find offensive or inappropriate?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-users-allowed-to-report-a-comment-they-find-offensive-or-inappropriate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes they can.  For every comment posted on the main chat room or in the reply section, there is a Flag button (depicted with an &#8220;Exclamation&#8221; image) that a user can click. Upon clicking, he or she can choose the reason as to why it is inappropriate .</p>
<p>Once reported, you will see this comment on your Client Dashboard.  All you need to do is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ACCEPT</span></code> the Flag (if you want to remove the respective Flagged comment from the Chat window) or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">REJECT</span></code> it (if you want to allow the comment). If you ACCEPT the flag, it will automatically disappear from the Chat Window.  This ensures that moderation is managed.</p>
